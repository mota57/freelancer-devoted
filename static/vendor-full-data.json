We take on the planning and execution so you are free to relax and enjoy the experience!\n Once youve decided we are your people, the next step is getting to know you and your style. We do all you planning and budgeting. Included in our services is an initial consultation where we spend a lot of time becoming familiar with your vision and understanding what you want in a bartending team. Next we start designing the menu. Then comes the fun- the cocktail tasting consultation!! . Here we make sure you are happy with the bar menu we designed and that you love our cocktails (which you will). After you determine you love everything, we handle the rest. We shop for all your alcohol and deliver it to your venue. It is important to note that per the state of Ohio we cannot sell you the alcohol, but we can provide you the bartending service. Alcohol purchase will be billed separately. On your big day we take care of setting up and staging the bar area, beverage service, and clean up and we do it all with a smile!

We test bake, we try new flavors and we aren't afraid of your grandma's baklava recipe; if it's what you want, we will make it happen. \n A few notes. We are not a fondant friendly bakery, we pride ourselves on being able to provide a smooth finish with just buttercream or chocolate ganache! We also love the texture designs that you can get with buttercream. Tasting Boxes-we offer a tasting box quarterly for $50 which allows you to try our different cake flavors, fillings and buttercreams. Buy a tasting box and book your wedding with us, we'll give you a $25 credit. Summer Weddings- if your cake will be outside or even in an open air facility then we need to protect your cake from the heat. This will affect what kinds of fillings and icings we can do. Set up and Delivery - We highly recommend allowing us to deliver and set up your cake. We even require delivery and set up for any cakes over 2 tiers. The fee will depend on the travel distance from our location in Blacklick. Need a favor guests will love? Our custom sugar cookies and gourmet cookies are always crowd pleasers! Curious about about pricing and flavor options? Here’s a quick reference guide. Don’t feel limited by these flavors, we are happy to accommodate special requests! ",

We offer vegan and gluten free options as well as normal sweets so that there is something for everyone! We love Columbus and are hoping to make an impact specifically in low income areas of our city that don’t have access to healthy food. \n I absolutely LOVE working with engaged couples and helping make their day-of visions  come to life. It's an honor to be even a small part of someone's big day and to hear that later guests still talk about the desserts they had. We have been an official LLC for a little over a year and have done over 20 weddings/large events. I look forward to meeting & working with you!",

Starting in the early 1800 the Ernst family moved into the area and built the original home in 1865. During the early period of American history, homebuilding was only accomplished by using material available from the land. Suitable clay was located and bricks for the Lodge were fired on site. Charles Ernst was a little over a year old at the time and his baby footprint impressions are in bricks at both the front and rear doors of the lodge. In 1955, a group of young family men purchased the property and created Mitchell Hills Golf Club. Mitchell Hills Club was formed with the idea in mind that wholesome recreation for the family could be possible at reasonable cost if each member contributed some time and effort and special talents for the maintenance and sociability or the club. With this in mind, the club grew overtime with several building additions and growing the membership to 200 plus families in the early 2000s. Like many small golf courses, declining membership and increased cost forced the Club to close in late 2018. As neighbors our family was sickened by\n ",

It is a historic venue sought out by people of all ages, from all walks of life, and from near and far. Its well-earned reputation as an intimate, casual setting for continuos offerings of both familiar and innovative artisitc performances and community events brings people back time and again.\nStuarts Opera House is the cornerstone of the Nelsonville Historic Art District. A lovinly restored theatre that reflects its glory days in 1879 through 1924 when it was home to vaudeville, melodrama, and minstrel shows. Stuarts closed and sat empty from 1924 through 1976. In 1977 a group fromed a non-profit and started bringing the theater back to life when a devastating fire nearly destroyed the building in 1980. Seventeen years later, in 1997, the opera house re-opened its doors and is once again home to local, regional, national and internationally acclaimed performances. Stuarts Opera House now hosts over 75 events each year and is Southeastern Ohios favorite place to expereince live performance. Please join us!",

They had to be natural products that would make her skin feel good inside and out. More importantly, she had to feel good about using them on her body.  \n\nFor me making product is very therapeutic, so I want them to feel just as soothing to others as they were to me when I created them.

We believe in community outreach, treating people the way we would want to be treated, and helping our practice members attain their best lives possible. We serve anyone with a spine and nervous system, whether they currently have symptoms or not. Our loyalty is to those that desire to be healthier tomorrow than they are today and those that want to reach their full potential. We have a particular passion for serving children and families and that passion comes from the life changing results we get to witness every day. Every single cell, tissue, and organ in your body has a direct nerve supply and is under the control of your central nervous system i.e. your brain and spinal cord. In short, every function within the body is regulated through the nerve system – growth, development, sleep, energy, digestion, healing and repair, strength, stamina, reproduction, immune system function, concentration, focus, cognition, and millions more.\n Dr. Joseph Benne has spent years learning and practicing the most advanced and scientifically researched chiropractic techniques available. Using these techniques, he is able to locate the very specific areas of increased tension along the spinal column which interfere with the signals going to and from the brain and the body. Chiropractors call these areas of increased tension, subluxations. When Dr. Joseph corrects the subluxations you and your children have, it allows your brain and body to be at one, which leads to optimal function and health.\nHealth is really all about. How well you are functioning determines how truly healthy you are. It’s more than just ‘feeling good’; it’s about functioning at your ultimate potential. When your body is functioning at 100%, you have the innate ability to adapt to anything that occurs in your environment and you can continually maintain optimal health. Decreased health results from a decreased ability to adapt to stressors (i.e. chemical, mental, and physical stressors). A decreased ability to adapt simply means you aren’t functioning at your highest level. ",

Essentially, you’re paying for a travel agent, even if you don’t use their services.. \nUnlike impersonal travel booking websites, we’ll go above and beyond to make sure all your needs are met and all your questions are answered. That’s personal attention you won’t find anywhere else.\nOur office is located in Easton Town Center (in the Columbus, Ohio area) but we work with clients all around the country by phone and email.\n Jennifer Kon, Owner and Travel Agent specializing in leisure vacations and honeymoons. \nCompass Travel’s owner, Jennifer Kon, was born to travel.

Others were just, well, stale. Many of them used recycled elements . readings that were in our opinion WAY overused. They focused on rituals that we had seen over and over (even doing the same ones for multiple clients) and we just didnt want that! We wanted something that expressed what we felt about each other,. with words that telegraphed our intentions, and symbolism that was about us and our relationship. We wanted inclusion, and a sense of community rather than formality.\n\n We knew that this was a special moment that we were actually changing our identity, and we really wanted to make a statement.\nThats why well we designed our own ceremony. Then we found a civil officiant who would help us present it.\nWe wrote our own vows (and really, the entire ceremony). We invited our guests to share their sentiments. We gathered in a small chapel where we could be surrounded by only our closest friends and family. We hand-picked music that we felt was about us. Part of our celebration centered on a local art studio, which we felt summed up the creativity that is a focus of our life together. We didnt have bridesmaids or groomsmen, or any recognizable liturgy. We were just authentically ourselves.\nIt was perfect.",

We have the ability to use the natural background, use lights, utilize an inflatable booth with silver background and lights or a black tent with lights as a more dramatic feature. The background can be customized for larger events to include a mascot, logo or name as well. For the finished product, we provide a custom overlay with your colors and design choice, a custom song and instant sharing as soon as the spin is complete. In addition, bride and groom will receive a link to view all of their guests spinning.  \n ",

Having shot over 85 weddings, I have experience that most couples dont have, as its usually their first wedding. I believe in photographing everything on a wedding day that looks like someone spent time or money on it. Those are the little details the important things that set your wedding apart from everyone elses. I believe in capturing your wedding authentically, moment by moment, not copying another photographers photos from Pinterest. I believe that real moments, real emotion and beautiful light creates the most magical wedding photos and thats what I aim to photograph every time I step into a wedding venue. I shoot every wedding as if it were a multi-million dollar wedding, no matter the budget.\n\nI also believe that your wedding photographer should add to your wedding day experience. We have fun. We laugh, we cry and yeah… we will dance at your reception!\n\n\n⁠\n A Little About Me: I'm one of those feely kind of people who loves love (enneagram 2w3 here) , but even more I love capturing relationships. Whether its a couple on their wedding day or a mom and daughter or daddy and son or siblings. I dont care, I just love real life and authentic moments and taking photos of all those things.⁠ When Im not working which I do A LOT (because Im a Capricorn and we tend to be workaholics 🤷), Im with my four kids or reading, journaling, meditating, working on my fitness journey or maybe getting another tattoo. Im a TOTAL space geek, Im an ambivert, a selenophile, I have dog and a cat, a SERIOUS coffee addiction and some intense life goals and dreams that Im working tirelessly on manifesting. I love crystals, candles, Taco Bell and I CANNOT live without music all kinds. Doesnt matter. But I do have a soft spot for driving the almost-two-lane country roads where I live, with the windows down and some Tyler Childers blaring on the radio.⁠ And I want to hang out with you. I want to learn about your love story, what you do together, your favorite places maybe grab some coffee?",

Our experience and heritage allows us to provide you with the highest quality service and most beautiful doves with thoroughbred blood lines. We are the premier white dove release specialists in Central and Northwest Ohio. The white dove is a symbol of love, peace, purity, hope, new beginnings, and spirituality. Regardless of your occasion, a dove release and display is a magnificent spectacle with attached meaningfulness and symbolism. Our pure white doves are a homing pigeon breed that gets pampered, well cared for, and thoroughly trained to return home, unlike the smaller, domesticated breed known as the ring neck dove that can not fend for itself in the wild nor find its way home. Since our doves are pampered and well trained we protect their welfare by not releasing them during inclement weather conditions.\n ",
