Starting in the early 1800 the Ernst family moved into the area and built the original home in 1865. During the early period of American history, homebuilding was only accomplished by using material available from the land. Suitable clay was located and bricks for the Lodge were fired on site. Charles Ernst was a little over a year old at the time and his baby footprint impressions are in bricks at both the front and rear doors of the lodge. In 1955, a group of young family men purchased the property and created Mitchell Hills Golf Club. Mitchell Hills Club was formed with the idea in mind that wholesome recreation for the family could be possible at reasonable cost if each member contributed some time and effort and special talents for the maintenance and sociability or the club. With this in mind, the club grew overtime with several building additions and growing the membership to 200 plus families in the early 2000s. Like many small golf courses, declining membership and increased cost forced the Club to close in late 2018. As neighbors our family was sickened by\n ",

It is dedicated to its role as a leader in the regional arts community, a center for public expression, and an economic development partner in Southeast Ohio.\nOur Vision\n We envision Stuarts Opera House as the cultural anchor and a center of expression on Nelsonvilles bustling and dynamic Public Square. It is a historic venue sought out by people of all ages, from all walks of life, and from near and far. Its well-earned reputation as an intimate, casual setting for continuos offerings of both familiar and innovative artisitc performances and community events brings people back time and again.\nStuarts Opera House is the cornerstone of the Nelsonville Historic Art District. A lovinly restored theatre that reflects its glory days in 1879 through 1924 when it was home to vaudeville, melodrama, and minstrel shows. Stuarts closed and sat empty from 1924 through 1976. In 1977 a group fromed a non-profit and started bringing the theater back to life when a devastating fire nearly destroyed the building in 1980. Seventeen years later, in 1997, the opera house re-opened its doors and is once again home to local, regional, national and internationally acclaimed performances. Stuarts Opera House now hosts over 75 events each year and is Southeastern Ohios favorite place to expereince live performance. Please join us!",
